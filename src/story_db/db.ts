        title: "Raman the detective",
        content: `Tenali Raman was once walking along a forest path when he was stopped by a merchant. “I'm looking for my camel which has strayed away. Did you see it passing by?” asked the merchant.

        “Had the camel hurt its leg?” asked Raman.

        “Oh yes! That means you have seen my camel!” said the merchant.

        “Only its footprints. See, you can see footprints of an animal with three legs,” said Raman, pointing out the footprints on the ground. “It was dragging the other leg because it was hurt in that leg.”
        “Was it blind in one eye?” Raman asked the merchant.

        “Yes, yes,” said the merchant eagerly.

        “Was it loaded it with wheat on one side and sugar on the other side?” asked Raman.

        “Yes, you are right,” said the merchant.

        “So you have seen my camel!”  exclaimed the merchant.

        Raman looked upset. “Did I say I saw your camel?”

        “You have given the exact description of my camel,” said the merchant.

        “I saw no camel,” said Raman.

        “Do you see those plants lined up on both sides of this path? You can clearly see, some animal has eaten leaves of plants on the left, but the plants on the other side remain untouched. So the animal could see with only one eye.

        “Look down. You can see ants lined up on this side which means, the animal was loaded with sugar bag on this side. The bag had a hole, which allowed the sugar to fall off.”
        “You can see grains of wheat fallen on the other side. The bag on this side also must have holes in it,” said Raman.

        “I can see everything you showed me,” protested the merchant,”but I still don't see my camel.”

        “You follow this trail and soon you will catch up with your animal. After all it is hurt in one leg and you seem to be hale and hearty,” said Raman.

        The merchant took his advice and followed the trail left by the camel.

        Soon he caught up with the poor animal, limping along.

        “Rani!” the merchant shouted in happiness, as he ran to his camel.`

        title: "The real mother",
        content: `Two women were fighting over a child. “He is my child, leave him alone,” cried the lady in the red sari. The poor child was too young to speak.

        “No, he is mine,” cried the woman in the green sari.
        
        Soon a crowd gathered.
        
        The village elders took the quarreling women to a wise man. The village wise man asked the lady in the red sari, “What do you have to say?”
        
        “He is my child, Sir. I was bathing in the river and had left my son on the bank. This woman lifted my child and ran away. I hurriedly dressed and ran after her,” said the woman.

        The wise man asked the other woman to explain.

        “She is a liar, Sir. I was the one bathing in the river. He is my only child. She came there, picked him up and ran. Luckily I could catch her,” said the other woman.
        
        Villagers who were watching this drama did not know whom to believe.
        
        The wise man got up. Using a twig, he drew a line on the ground. He asked the two women to stand on either side of the line, and placed the child in the middle. As instructed by the wise man, one woman held the child's left hand and the other, his right hand.
        
        “Now listen to me carefully,” said the wise man, “Both of you need to pull the child to your side. The child belongs to whoever drags him over to her side.”

        The woman in red sari pulled the child hard with all her might. As the child cried in pain, the other woman, let him go.

        “He is mine,” the woman in the red sari shouted in triumph, even as the other woman broke down in tears.

        “Wait,” said the wise man turning to the villagers, “Who do you think loves the child more? She who pulled the child to her side or the one who let the child go?”

        The villagers answered, “She who let go loves the child more.”

        The wise man took the child away from the woman in the red sari. “Only a mother can have a tender heart for her child,” he said.

        He handed the child over to the real mother who hugged the child. The child lifter was given a strict warning and allowed to go.

        title: "Krishna in Sudama's village",
        content: `When Sudama went to Dwaraka, his childhood friend Sri Krishna and his wife Rukmini, received him with affection. They persuaded Sudama to stay with them for a few days. Then they took him back to his village in their chariot.

        Meanwhile, in the village, word spread that Sri Krishna was coming to their village. Villagers began to gather in Sudama's cottage.
        
        “Sri Krishna and Rukmini are visiting our Sudama's house. We must make it fit for their visit,” said an elder.
        
        “Let's build a new home for our Sudama,” cried out a villager and all agreed.
        
        The villagers worked day and night to build a big and spacious house, and decorated it with festoons. They brought new clothes and ornaments for Sudama's family. They drew Rangoli (Kolam) in front of Sudama's house and decorated it with flowers.
        
        Sudama's wife thanked the villagers for their affection.
        Villagers lined up on both sides of the streets hailing Sri Krishna as he drove by. Sri Krishna stopped the chariot, jumped down and mingled with the villagers. Girls came running to him with dandiya and Sri Krishna danced with them.

        At last, the procession reached Sudama's house. Sudama's wife brought water for Sri Krishna and Rukmini to wash their feet. Sudama wiped their feet dry with the cloth his wife gave him. His children fell at Sri Krishna's feet.

        “Bhabhi,” said Sri Krishna, “I'm hungry. What do you have for me?”

        Sudama's wife smiled.

        “Govinda, I offer you what you have given us,” she said.

        Then she brought him a bowl full of butter!

        Sri Krishna jumped with joy as Rukmini clapped. The villagers joined their hands in salutation as Sri Krishna put the butter into his mouth.`
